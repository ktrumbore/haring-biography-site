          <h1>The Artist with a Radiant Vision</h1>
          <h2>Get to know the story behind Keith Haring.</h2>
          <p>From the Radiant Baby emblazoned on the walls of the New York subway to his <i>Crack is Wack</i> mural in Harlem, the work of late American artist Keith Haring is joyously irreverent and instantly recognizable. Haring is remembered alongside his contemporaries Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat as one of the formative visual artists of 1980s New York, whose practice traversed pop, graffiti art, and visual activism. 
            <br>
            <br> Although Keith Haring passed away at the age of 31 shortly after being diagnosed with AIDS in 1990, his legacy lives on in the public artworks he created around the world, the memorable collaborations with everyone from Vivienne Westwood to David Bowie, and the work of the Keith Haring Foundation, which funds non-profit organizations to educate disadvantaged youth about HIV and AIDS. His animated imagery has become a widely recognized visual language and serves as an ongoing inspiration for artists around the globe. </p>

            <h1>Art School Dropout</h1>
            <h2>A career that began with cartoons and comics.</h2>
            <p>Keith Haring was born on May 4, 1958, in Reading, Pennsylvania, and raised in nearby Kutztown, Pennsylvania. Keith Haring began to draw extensively by the age of four, encouraged by his father who worked as an amateur cartoonist. Keith Haring was just twelve years old when he produced a drawing (measuring five meters in width) for a comic strip entitled “Peterson & Company.” 
              <br>
              <br> Graduating from high school in 1976, Haring enrolled in the Ivy School of Professional Art in Pittsburgh, a commercial arts school, only to drop out two semesters later. It was not until 1978 when Haring moved to New York City and enrolled in the School of Visual Arts (SVA) that he found a place in the arts.</p>

            <h1>Catching The Public Eye</h1>
            <h2>How Keith Haring rose to fame in New York’s subways.</h2>
            <p>Some of Haring’s earliest public works were created on the walls of the New York City subway. When the artist noticed that advertising spaces were being left bare and covered with matte black paper, he took advantage of the empty canvases and drew on them in white chalk. 
              <br>
              <br>But while passersby were generally curious and positive about his artworks, the subway drawings lead to Keith Haring being arrested on multiple occasions and charged for vandalism.</p>

            <h2>The name known around the world.</h2>
            <p>Between 1980 and 1989, Haring achieved international recognition and participated in numerous group and solo exhibitions. The pop artist would go on to complete numerous public projects in the first half of the 1980, ranging from an animation for the Spectacolor billboard in Times Square, designing sets and backdrops for theaters and clubs, developing watch designs for Swatch and an advertising campaign for Absolut vodka, and creating murals worldwide.</p>
