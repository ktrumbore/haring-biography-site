          <h1>The Artist with a Radiant Vision</h1>
          <h2>Get to know the story behind Keith Haring.</h2>
          <p>From the <i>Radiant Baby</i> emblazoned on the walls of the New York subway to his <i>Crack is Wack</i> mural in Harlem, the work of late American artist Keith Haring is joyously irreverent and instantly recognizable. Haring is remembered alongside his contemporaries Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat as one of the formative visual artists of 1980s New York, whose practice traversed pop, graffiti art, and visual activism. 
            <br>
            <br> Although Keith Haring passed away at the age of 31 shortly after being diagnosed with AIDS in 1990, his legacy lives on in the public artworks he created around the world, the memorable collaborations with everyone from Vivienne Westwood to David Bowie, and the work of the Keith Haring Foundation, which funds non-profit organizations to educate disadvantaged youth about HIV and AIDS. His animated imagery has become a widely recognized visual language and serves as an ongoing inspiration for artists around the globe. </p>

            <div class="overlay"><h2>ABOUT PIECE</h2><p>Between the summer of 1980 and January 1981, Haring created <i>The Blueprint Drawings,</i> perhaps the most iconic and relevant of his career.

Like Haring, Scharf used bold colors with a flare for the surreal. Here, Haring took cartoon imagery to a new level, portraying the wolf as simultaneously charming and daunting.</p></div>

            <h1>Art School Dropout</h1>
            <h2>A career that began with cartoons and comics.</h2>
            <p>Keith Haring was born on May 4, 1958, in Reading, Pennsylvania, and raised in nearby Kutztown, Pennsylvania. Keith Haring began to draw extensively by the age of four, encouraged by his father who worked as an amateur cartoonist. Keith Haring was just twelve years old when he produced a drawing (measuring five meters in width) for a comic strip entitled “Peterson & Company.” 
              <br>
              <br> Graduating from high school in 1976, Haring enrolled in the Ivy School of Professional Art in Pittsburgh, a commercial arts school, only to drop out two semesters later. It was not until 1978 when Haring moved to New York City and enrolled in the School of Visual Arts (SVA) that he found a place in the arts.</p>

            <h1>Catching The Public Eye</h1>
            <h2>How Keith Haring rose to fame in New York’s subways.</h2>
            <p>Some of Haring’s earliest public works were created on the walls of the New York City subway. When the artist noticed that advertising spaces were being left bare and covered with matte black paper, he took advantage of the empty canvases and drew on them in white chalk. 
              <br>
              <br>But while passersby were generally curious and positive about his artworks, the subway drawings lead to Keith Haring being arrested on multiple occasions and charged for vandalism.</p>

            <p>Between 1980 and 1989, Haring achieved international recognition and participated in numerous group and solo exhibitions. The pop artist would go on to complete numerous public projects in the first half of the 1980, ranging from an animation for the Spectacolor billboard in Times Square, designing sets and backdrops for theaters and clubs, developing watch designs for Swatch and an advertising campaign for Absolut vodka, and creating murals worldwide.</p>

            <h1>A Persistent Cry For Justice</h1>
            <h2>Keith Haring was not afraid of making a stand.</h2>
            <p>As much as Haring was a respected and celebrated visual artist, he was also a fervent and committed political activist, who saw art not only as a right for everyone to enjoy, but also as a means of spreading messages about global politics and social issues. Many of his artworks, such as <i>Ignorance = Fear,</i> display a joyful expression of pride in his own sexuality and an active promotion of safe sex at a time when the social climate in 1980s America was one that was outwardly homophobic. He also created designs that made powerful statements on issues such as Apartheid, income equality, and climate change.</p>

              <h2>How art can make the world a better place.</h2>
              <p>From when he began creating art in the late seventies up to his death in 1990, Keith Haring produced work that was both intense and explicit around sex and sexuality. The year before his death, Keith Haring established the Keith Haring Foundation to support underserved children and AIDS organizations, a foundation which still operates today. <br>
                <br>
                The Keith Haring Foundation gifts grants to organizations which provide educational opportunities to underprivileged children and organizations which engage in research with respect to AIDS and HIV infection. There are an estimated 38 million people living with the virus worldwide today, and despite the virus only being identified in 1984, more than 35 million people have died of HIV or AIDS, making it one of the most destructive pandemics in history.</p>
            </div>
  
           <div class="card-2">
              <p>Today, scientific advances have been made in HIV treatment, there are laws to protect people living with HIV, and we have much more knowledge about the condition. And, after over 30 years of the HIV pandemic, the world may soon witness the birth of an AIDS-free generation, with new infections in children reduced by more than half globally. But the work isn’t done yet.<br>

        <h4><b>Heritage of Pride.</b> 1980s.</h4>

        <div class="closing">
          <p>Keith Haring was a popular artist and activist who was part of the legendary New York art scene during the 1980s. While he is known for his colorful works and his iconic motifs such as the radiant baby and the barking dog, much of Keith Haring’s work responded to contemporary social and political events as a call for change. By opening up the art world, taking art back to the people, and sharing it with those he was speaking up for, Haring achieved a long-lasting artistic legacy that continues to inspire others to this day.<br>
